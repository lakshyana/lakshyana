- 👋 Hi, I’m Lakshyana KC, an MS in AI student at Northeastern University, Boston.
- 💞️ I have a strong passion in applying technology for social impact and have been following this passion since my undergraduate years through my work experiences at several non-profit projects around the world. 
- 📖 In grad school, I have specialized in the field of AI and Machine Learning. In an increasingly data-centric world, I am fascinated by the growing power and potential of Machine Learning applications to transform multiple sectors.
- 👀 I am actively seeking machine learning engineer Spring internship as well as fulltime roles and open to computer vision, natural language processing, or multimodal projects.

- 👩‍💻 I’m happy to collaborate on projects where I can put my learnings to practice and learn from one another. 
- 📫 You can reach me at my firstname.lastname@nyu.edu for further communication.
